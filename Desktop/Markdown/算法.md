## Background and Related Work
### Vertex Decimation
* method:
1. iteratively selects a vertex for removal
2. removes all adjacent faces
3. retriangulates the resulting hole
* limitaion:
1. use vertex classification and retriangulation schemes which are limited to manifold surfaces
2. maintain the topology of the model,which are restrictions for multiresolution rendering systems

### Vertex Clustering
* capable of processing **arbitary** polygonal input
* every vertex in a cell is clustered into a single vertex
* the faces are updated accordingly.
* limitation
1. the quality of the output is quite low.
2. difficult to construct an approximation with **a specific face count**
3. don't support the quality and control that we desire

### Iterative Edge Contraction
* essential difference between different algorithms : **how they choose an edge to contract**
* limitation:
1. can not join **unconnected** regions
2. seem to have been designed for **manifold surfaces**



## Our algorithm
* based on iterative contraction of vertex pairs. Supports both aggregation and high quality approximations.
A pair contraction ,which we'll write (v~1~,v~2~) $\to$  $ \bar v$

1. move the vertices v~1~ and v~2~ to the new position $ \bar v$, 
2. connect **all their incident edges ** to $ \bar v$
3. delete the vertex v~2~ ,remove all the faces and edges that are degenerated

if(v~1~,v~2~) is a edge, 1 or more faces will be removed, else 2 previously separate sections of the model will be joined at $\bar v$ 

### Aggregation 

* join previously unconnected regions of the model together
* make the algorithm less sensitive to the mesh connectivity to the original model

### Pair Selection 

Assumption: in a good approximation, points don't move far from their **original positions.**

* a valid pair : (v~1~, v~2~) is an edge or || v~1~ - v~2~ || < t,where t is a threshold parameter

something about the threshold parameter t: 

1. Higher threshold allow non-connected vertices to be paired.
2. if it's too **high** ,widely separated portions of the model could be connected, which is undesirable, and it could create O(n^2^) pairs(that every vertex in the model)

## Approximating Error With Quadrics
* each vertex's cost: a symmetric 4 $\times$ 4 matrix **Q**   ,define the error at vertex v =[v~x~, v~y~, v~z~ ,1]^T^  to be the quadratic form $\Delta$(v) = v^T^ **Q~v~** 

after we make a contraction (v~1~,v~2~)$\to$ $\bar v$,the new  error matrix$\bar Q$ = **Q~1~**  + **Q~2~**  
* the position of the new vertex $\bar v$

a simple scheme would be to select v~1~ or v~2~ ,or (v~1~ + v~2~), depending on which of them produces **lowest value of $ \Delta$(v)** 

But it's better to find a position to minimize the $\Delta$(v).Then we find the position by solving $\partial {\Delta}/\partial{x}$ = 0, $\partial {\Delta}/\partial{y}$ = 0,  $\partial {\Delta}/\partial{z}$ = 0

#### Algorithm Summary

1. Compute the **Q** matrices for all the initial vertices
2. Select all valid pairs
3. Compute the optimal contraction target $\bar v$ for each valid pair(v~1~, v~2~), The error $\bar v$^T^ (**Q~1~** ,**Q~2~**)$\bar v$ of this target vertex becomes the cost of contracting that pair

## Deriving Error Quadrics
$\Delta$(v) = $\Delta$([v~x~,v~y~,v~z~,1]^T^)= $\sum_{p\in planes(V) }^{}$ (p^T^v)^2^ ,also $\Delta$(v) = v^T^ $(\sum_{p\in planes(v)}K_p)v$ ,where K~p~ = $pp^T$ = $\begin {bmatrix} a^2 & ab & ac & ad\\ab& b^2& bc& bd\\ac& bc& c^2 & cd \\ ad & bd & cd & d^2 \end{bmatrix} $

* each vertex is the solution of the intersection of a set of planes .Thus define the error of the vertex with respect to this set set as the sum of squared distances to its planes.
* $p$ = [a,b,c,d]^T^ ,represents the plane defined by the equation $ax + by + cz +d = 0$ ,where $a^2 + b^2 + c^2  =1 $
* **Track the set of the planes** : after a contraction (v~1~,v~2~) $\to $ $\bar v$ ,we would propagate planes by **using rules: planes($\bar v$) = planes (v~1~ ) $\bigcup $ planes(v~2~). Require a sizeable amount of storage that doesn't diminish as simplification progresses.

## Additional Details

some enhancements which improve its performance on **certain types of models**,particularly planar models with open boundaries
### Preserving Boundaries
For models like terrain height fields, it's necessary to preserve boundary curves while simplifying
### Preventing Mesh Inversion
Pair contractions don't necessarily preserve the orientation of the faces in the area of the contraction.We use the same scheme as others have before .When considering a possible contraction, we compare the normal of each neighboring face before and after the contraction.If the normal flips ,that contraction can be either heavily penalized or disallowed.
### Evaluating Approximations
* The approximation error **E~i~**  =**E(M~n~,M~i~)** =
$$
\frac{1}{|X_n| + |X_i|} (\sum_{v\in X_n}d^2(v,M^i) + \sum_{v\in X_j}d^2(v,M_n))
$$

* X~n~ and X~i~ are sets of points sampled on the models M~n~ and M~i~ .
* The distance $d(v,M)$ = $min_{p\in M} ||v-p||$  is the minimum distance from $v$ to the cloest face of M
